### Summary
To persist directory listings from your Rust program to a database, you can use an ORM like `diesel` or a lightweight solution like `rusqlite`. The general approach involves reading the directory, storing the entries, and inserting them into your database. Here’s an outline of the steps to achieve this.

### Steps to Persist Directory Listings to a Database

1. **Read Directory Entries**:
   Use the `std::fs` module to read the directory entries.

2. **Choose a Database**:
   Select a database, e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL, etc., and set up the appropriate crate (`diesel`, `rusqlite`, etc.).

3. **Set Up Database Schema**:
   Define your table schema based on the directory listing you want to persist.

4. **Insert Entries**:
   Iterate over the directory entries and insert them into the database.

### Example using `rusqlite`

Here’s a basic example using `rusqlite` to insert directory entries into an SQLite database.

```rust
use std::fs;
use rusqlite::{params, Connection};

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let dir_path = "your/directory/path"; // Update with your directory path
    let conn = Connection::open("directory_listings.db")?;

    // Create table
    conn.execute(
        "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS entries (
            id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
            name TEXT NOT NULL
        )",
        [],
    )?;

    // Read directory and insert entries
    for entry in fs::read_dir(dir_path)? {
        let entry = entry?;
        let name = entry.file_name().into_string().unwrap();
        
        conn.execute("INSERT INTO entries (name) VALUES (?1)", params![name])?;
    }

    Ok(())
}
```

### Considerations
- Make sure to handle errors appropriately in your actual implementation.
- Adjust the database schema as needed based on the properties you want to store.
- If you expect a large number of entries, consider using batch inserts for better performance.
