### Using SQLx with SQLite in Rust

If you’re diving into Rust and want to work with databases, SQLx is a fantastic choice. This tutorial explores the basics of using SQLx with SQLite, a lightweight embedded SQL database engine. By the end, you’ll understand how to create an SQLite database, perform SQL operations, and set up migrations.

#### What is SQLx?
SQLx is an async SQL crate for Rust with key features:
- **Compile-time Checked Queries**: Ensures queries are valid at compile time, reducing runtime errors.
- **Async Support**: Works with async runtimes like async-std, tokio, and actix.
- **Cross-Platform**: Compiles anywhere Rust is supported.
- **Connection Pooling**: Built-in pooling for efficient access.

Supported databases include PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, and MSSQL.

#### What is SQLite?
SQLite is an embedded SQL database engine that is serverless and lightweight:
- **Compact**: Library size can be less than 750KiB.
- **Cross-Platform**: Database format works across different systems.
- **Popular**: Widely used in applications, especially on edge devices.

### Project Setup
1. **Create a new Rust project**:
   ```bash
   cargo new sqlx-sqlite-basics-tutorial
   ```

2. **Add dependencies in `Cargo.toml`**:
   ```toml
   [dependencies]
   sqlx = { version = "0.6.2", features = ["runtime-tokio-native-tls", "sqlite"] }
   tokio = { version = "1.20.0", features = ["macros"] }
   ```

### SQLx Basics with SQLite
1. **Define your data struct**:
   ```rust
   #[derive(Debug, sqlx::FromRow)]
   struct User {
       id: i32,
       username: String,
       email: String,
   }
   ```

2. **Establish a connection**:
   ```rust
   let pool = sqlx::sqlite::SqlitePool::connect("sqlite:mydb.db").await?;
   ```

3. **Execute SQL queries**:
   ```rust
   let users: Vec<User> = sqlx::query_as!("SELECT * FROM users").fetch_all(&pool).await?;
   ```

### SQLx Migrations
1. **Install SQLx CLI**:
   ```bash
   cargo install sqlx-cli
   ```

2. **Create a migration**:
   ```bash
   sqlx migrate add create_users_table
   ```

3. **Apply migrations**:
   ```rust
   sqlx::migrate!().run(&pool).await?;
   ```

### Conclusion
SQLx simplifies database interactions in Rust, and SQLite is an excellent choice for lightweight applications. With SQLx, you’ll be well-equipped to handle databases in your future Rust projects.
