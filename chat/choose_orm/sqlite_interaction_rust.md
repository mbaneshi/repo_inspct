For SQLite interaction in your Rust application, you can use the following tools:

1. **rusqlite**: This is the most commonly used SQLite binding for Rust. It provides a simple and straightforward API for interacting with SQLite databases.

   ```toml
   [dependencies]
   rusqlite = "0.28"  # Check for the latest version
   ```

2. **diesel**: If you want an ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) with a bit more structure, Diesel is a great option. It supports SQLite and provides type safety and compile-time checks.

   ```toml
   [dependencies]
   diesel = { version = "1.4", features = ["sqlite"] }  # Check for the latest version
   ```

3. **sqlite**: This is a low-level binding to SQLite if you want to work directly with the SQLite C API.

   ```toml
   [dependencies]
   sqlite = "0.26"  # Check for the latest version
   ```

4. **rusqlite-cli**: If you need a command-line interface for running SQL commands directly against your SQLite database, consider installing this CLI tool.

   ```bash
   cargo install rusqlite-cli
   ```

### Example Usage with `rusqlite`

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use `rusqlite` in your Rust app:

```rust
use rusqlite::{params, Connection, Result};

fn main() -> Result<()> {
    let conn = Connection::open("my_database.db")?;

    conn.execute(
        "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS person (
            id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
            name TEXT NOT NULL,
            data BLOB
        )",
        [],
    )?;

    conn.execute(
        "INSERT INTO person (name, data) VALUES (?1, ?2)",
        params!["Alice", "Some data"],
    )?;

    let mut stmt = conn.prepare("SELECT id, name, data FROM person")?;
    let person_iter = stmt.query_map([], |row| {
        Ok((row.get::<_, i32>(0)?, row.get::<_, String>(1)?))
    })?;

    for person in person_iter {
        println!("{:?}", person?);
    }

    Ok(())
}
```

### Summary

- Use **rusqlite** for straightforward SQLite interactions.
- Consider **Diesel** if you prefer an ORM.
- Install **rusqlite-cli** for a command-line interface to interact with your SQLite database.
