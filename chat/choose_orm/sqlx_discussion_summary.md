### Summary:
1. **Advanced Features of SQLx**:
   - **Row Streaming**: Efficiently handle large datasets using asynchronous row fetching.
   - **Asynchronous Notifications**: Utilize PostgreSQL's `LISTEN` and `NOTIFY` for real-time updates.
   - **Nested Transactions**: Manage complex transactions with save points for partial rollbacks.

2. **Migrations and Schema Management**:
   - Use `sqlx-cli` for creating and managing database migrations.
   - Best practices include version control, defining rollback migrations, testing in staging, creating backups, and documenting changes.

3. **Testing with SQLx**:
   - Strategies include mocking for unit tests, integration tests with a test database, and using in-memory SQLite for fast testing.
   - Example code demonstrates how to set up an in-memory database for testing.

4. **Real-World Applications**:
   - Case studies illustrate SQLx's effectiveness in production environments, like e-commerce and real-time analytics.
   - Performance benchmarks show SQLx outperforming other libraries in terms of query latency and throughput.
