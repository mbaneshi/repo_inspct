Switching to PostgreSQL is a great choice, especially for more complex applications. If you decide to go that route, using an ORM like **Diesel** or **SQLx** can help streamline your database interactions and provide added benefits like compile-time safety and query building.

### Recommended ORMs for PostgreSQL in Rust:

1. **Diesel**: 
   - Pros: Strong type safety, excellent documentation, and active community support.
   - Cons: Can have a steeper learning curve, especially with migrations.

   ```toml
   [dependencies]
   diesel = { version = "1.4", features = ["postgres"] }
   ```

2. **SQLx**: 
   - Pros: Asynchronous support, no code generation required, and compile-time query checking.
   - Cons: Slightly less type safety compared to Diesel but very flexible.

   ```toml
   [dependencies]
   sqlx = { version = "0.5", features = ["postgres", "runtime-async-std"] }
   ```

### Example Usage with Diesel

Here's a simple example of using Diesel with PostgreSQL:

1. Add the following dependencies in your `Cargo.toml`:

   ```toml
   [dependencies]
   diesel = { version = "1.4", features = ["postgres"] }
   dotenv = "0.15"  # For environment variable support
   ```

2. Create a basic model and interact with the database:

   ```rust
   #[macro_use]
   extern crate diesel;
   use diesel::prelude::*;
   use dotenv::dotenv;
   use std::env;

   table! {
       users (id) {
           id -> Int4,
           name -> Varchar,
       }
   }

   #[derive(Queryable)]
   struct User {
       id: i32,
       name: String,
   }

   fn main() {
       dotenv().ok();
       let database_url = env::var("DATABASE_URL").expect("DATABASE_URL must be set");
       let connection = PgConnection::establish(&database_url)
           .expect(&format!("Error connecting to {}", database_url));

       // Interact with your database here...
   }
   ```

### Transition Tips

- When transitioning to PostgreSQL, keep in mind any differences in data types and SQL syntax.
- Use migrations to keep your database schema organized and versioned.

Feel free to ask if you need help with the transition or further examples!
