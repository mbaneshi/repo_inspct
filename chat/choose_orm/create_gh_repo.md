To create a new GitHub repository using the GitHub CLI (`gh`) and set it as a remote for your current directory, follow these steps:

1. **Ensure You Have GitHub CLI Installed**:
   Make sure you have the GitHub CLI installed. You can check by running:
   ```bash
   gh --version
   ```

2. **Log in to GitHub**:
   If you haven't logged in yet, use:
   ```bash
   gh auth login
   ```

3. **Create the Repository**:
   Use the following command to create a new repository. Replace `<repo-name>` with your desired repository name:
   ```bash
   gh repo create <repo-name> --public
   ```
   You can use `--private` if you want the repository to be private.

4. **Set Up Remote Origin**:
   After creating the repository, you need to set it as the remote for your current directory:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/<repo-name>.git
   ```

5. **Verify the Remote**:
   You can verify that the remote has been set correctly:
   ```bash
   git remote -v
   ```

### Summary
- Ensure `gh` is installed and logged in.
- Create a new repository with `gh repo create`.
