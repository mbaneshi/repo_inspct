### SQLx Features Explained

1. **Async Support**: SQLx is designed for asynchronous programming using Rust's async/await syntax, allowing efficient handling of concurrent database operations.

2. **Compile-time Checked Queries**: SQLx provides macros like `query!` and `query_as!` that validate SQL queries at compile time against a connected database. This ensures SQL syntax correctness and type safety.

3. **Database Support**:
   - **PostgreSQL**
   - **MySQL/MariaDB**
   - **SQLite** (with limitations on pure Rust for safety)
   - **MSSQL** (limited support, pending rewrite)

4. **Runtime Options**: SQLx supports various async runtimes:
   - **Tokio**
   - **Async-Std**
   - **Actix**

5. **TLS Backends**: It supports multiple TLS backends for secure connections:
   - **Native TLS** (OpenSSL on UNIX)
   - **Rustls** (cross-platform, safer alternative)

6. **Connection Pooling**: Built-in pooling allows efficient management of database connections.

7. **Row Streaming**: Supports asynchronous data retrieval, allowing you to process rows on-the-fly.

8. **Nested Transactions**: Features save points for advanced transaction management.

9. **Any Database Driver**: Allows runtime database driver changes through an `Any` pool.

10. **Migration Support**: SQLx can manage database migrations with macros.

11. **Additional Features**:
    - **Date/Time Support**: Integration with `chrono` and `time` crates.
    - **JSON Support**: Built-in handling for JSON types.
    - **UUID Support**: Easily manage UUIDs in PostgreSQL.
