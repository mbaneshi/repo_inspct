To run a Rust program from a `main.rs` file in a Git repository with a `Cargo.toml`, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to Your Project Directory**:
   Open your terminal and navigate to the directory containing your Rust project. For example:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/project
   ```

2. **Build the Project**:
   Use Cargo to build your project:
   ```bash
   cargo build
   ```

3. **Run the Project**:
   After building, you can run your project with:
   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```

This will compile and execute your `main.rs` file located in the `src` folder of your project.

### Summary
- Navigate to your project directory.
- Build using `cargo build`.
