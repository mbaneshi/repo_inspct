## Book Title: "Persisting File and Folder Structures in PostgreSQL with Diesel"

### 1. Introduction
   - Overview of the project: Persisting files and folders
   - Importance of data persistence in command-line tools
   - Brief introduction to Diesel and PostgreSQL

### 2. Setting Up the Environment
   - Installing Rust and Cargo
   - Setting up PostgreSQL
     - Installation and configuration
   - Adding Diesel to your project
     - Updating `Cargo.toml` with Diesel dependencies

### 3. Initializing Diesel
   - Running `diesel setup`
   - Creating a new Diesel project
   - Configuring the database URL in `.env`

### 4. Defining the Database Schema
   - Overview of schema design for files and folders
     - Tables: `files`, `folders`
   - Creating a migration for the schema
     - Using `diesel migration generate create_files_and_folders`
   - Writing migration scripts
     - Defining columns and data types
     - Establishing relationships

### 5. Preparing the Database
   - Running migrations with `diesel migration run`
   - Verifying the schema in PostgreSQL
   - Understanding the role of migrations in schema management

### 6. Creating Models and Structs
   - Defining Rust structs for `File` and `Folder`
   - Implementing the `Queryable` trait for reading from the database
   - Using `Insertable` for persisting data

### 7. Interacting with the Database
   - Establishing a database connection
   - Writing functions to:
     - Insert new files and folders
     - Query existing files and folders
     - Update and delete records

### 8. Command-Line Tool Development
   - Structuring the command-line interface (CLI)
   - Accepting user input for file and folder operations
   - Persisting changes to the PostgreSQL database

### 9. Best Practices for Data Persistence
   - Error handling and logging
   - Managing database connections efficiently
   - Performance considerations for large directories

### 10. Testing Your Application
   - Setting up tests for database interactions
   - Using mocks for testing without affecting the actual database
   - Writing unit tests for command-line functionality

### 11. Conclusion
   - Summary of what was covered
   - Encouragement for further exploration of Diesel and PostgreSQL
   - Next steps for expanding functionality

### 12. Appendices
   - Reference for Diesel commands
   - Links to PostgreSQL documentation
   - Sample code snippets for common tasks
